\framesubtitle{Concept drifts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item concept drifts occurring in data streams will jeopardize the accuracy and stability
    \item if the data stream is imbalanced, it will be even more challenging to detect and handle the concept drift
    \item these two problems have been intensively addressed separately
    \item they have yet to be well studied when they occur together
\end{itemize}
